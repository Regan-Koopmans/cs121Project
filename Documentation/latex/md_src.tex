\#\+Source Folder

This folder contains all source files for the project. \+:sunglasses\+:

\subsection*{Structure of the Project}

This is the structure of the project, when we are complete with a task we can put a \+:heavy\+\_\+check\+\_\+mark\+: next to it. I think that we should work outside the folders, and then copy files into the folders when the tasks are done.

\subsubsection*{Task1}

This task is concerned with the unit hierarchy, and therefore includes the creational design patterns.

\subsubsection*{Task2}

This task is about the Game Master and the U

\subsubsection*{Task3}

This task is concerned with tying the whole system together.

\subsubsection*{Task4}

I have no idea what we have to do for task 4 yet \+:joy\+:

\subsubsection*{Task5 (Bonus)}

This is a bonus task for getting graphics to work in the game.
